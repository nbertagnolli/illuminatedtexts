Poetry is beautiful and deserves to be illustrated. I created IlluminatedTexts to illustrate some of my favorite poems using modern generative machine learning models.  Each week I'll post a new poem illustrated by OpenAI's Dalle-2.  Generative art is one of the most fun and delightful technologies humans have created.  If you're interested in my other work please checkout my [blog](https://www.nbertagnolli.com).  If there is a poem in the public domain you'd like illustrated please send me an email with the subject line "illuminatedtexts poem request" and I'll add it to my queue.
